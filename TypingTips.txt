Remember to sit up straight and maintain a straight back.
Keep your elbows appropriately bent.
Your head should be slightly cocked forward and facing the screen.

Keep your eyes at least 45 to 70 cm away from the screen.
Avoid putting too much stress on the muscles in your wrist, arm, and shoulder. The tabletop in front of the keyboard is reachable by the wrists. Never let your wrists support your weight by doing so.


When typing, avoid looking at the keys. Simply move your fingertips around until you locate the marking for the home row.

Just the minimum amount of hand and finger movement is required to push a particular key. Keep your fingers and hands close to the ground. This lessens hand stress and increases typing speed.

Pay close attention to your little and ring fingers as they are both severely undeveloped.



Always remember 
Accuracy is more important than speed...
